TAC Sticky Controls
================

Another mod by Thunder Aerospace Corporation, Sticky Controls makes attitude control inputs persist over time rather than being instantaneous.

Flavor text:
Someone (Bill?) got a little too excited during their last flight and spilled their drink on the control panel. Now the control stick won't return to neutral when released! The weird thing is, some kerbonauts are saying the ship is now _easier_ to fly.

### Features
**NOT ALL FEATURES ARE IMPLEMENTED YET.**
- Each attitude control input (the WASD keys) moves the controls by a small amount, and the controls do not return to neutral when released. Works kind of like trim, but more adjustable and easier to work with. May be familiar to players of the Microsoft Flight Simulator series.
- Fully adjustable: easy to change the amount the controls move per key press.
- Center controls by pressing Z.
- Can be toggled on/off whenever desired. Shortcut: Alt+Z.
- Displays a small window showing the current control positions, along with the configurable settings.
- The window can be shown or hidden by clicking the button, which can be displayed on its own, in Blizzy's toolbar, or in the stock toolbar.
